## Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to improving my competitive programming skills by solving various problems. The problems are sourced from platforms like AtCoder, Codeforces, and LeetCode.

## Directory Structure
- `problems/`: Contains the problem statements and links to the problem pages.
- `solutions/`: Contains the source code for each solution, organized by platform and difficulty level.
- `tests/`: Test cases for the problems to verify the solutions.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts to run, test, and submit solutions.

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the `solutions/` directory.
2. Choose the problem you want to solve or review.
3. Compile and run the code using the following command:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 solution.cpp -o solution
   ./solution < input.txt
